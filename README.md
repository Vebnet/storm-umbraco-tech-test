# This is the Storm Umbraco Candidate Technical Test

# Introduction
This test is designed to allow you to show us your knowledge and experience of Umbraco within a *real world* example.

We have created a set of html wireframes for a new website.  To get started either download the current latest master release (.zip) or fork the repository and work from there, the choice is yours.

Your task is to integrate the supplied wireframes into a new Umbraco site and make them dynamic so that an Umbraco Admin user can update this mini website.

We are looking for a Visual Studio solution that contains the new Umbraco website.  Remember to include an Umbraco username and password so that we can log in

The task is designed to form discussion points during an interview.

We will be looking at how the templates are integrated, how the Umbraco Document Types are configured, ease of use for the Admin users, etc.

# Things to Consider
These are things that might help you while you are integrating the templates.
* Dynamic Navigation
* Admin controlled feature panels on the home page
* Optional header images on article pages (About Us)
* Optional images on News page
* Contact Us form to save data into Umbraco and/or database table (without using the Umbraco Forms package)
* Custom Umbraco Admin Section to export Contact Us form data
* Meta data updated by Admin user

# Optional things to look at
These are things that are completely optional. They would generally be things we add in while building a "real" site, but we are not expecting them to be completed. We might end up discussing your thoughts on them during the interview.

* Paging on the news listing page
* News only search
